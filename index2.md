		Introduction

	<p>
		Hello and welcome to my personal website and portfolio. This is just a tempory website to act as a place for me to compile code samples, projects, and experience in one, easy-to-access location. As I build my experience in web developement I will be making regular updates to this website. So please take a look around and contact me with any questions.

	<h1>
		Current Project
	</h1>
	<p>
		I am currently finishing up a year of industry in software as a systems software developer working with C++ and machine learning libraries (more details below) but as of October 2020 I will be returning to research as part of the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Advanced Computing (CDT AIMLAC) PhD programme.

		Personal Statement
	</h1>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>I am a driven and hard-working individual currently working in software and shifting to research in October of 2020. 
			<li>I have spent the last six years of my life in full-time education whilst also obtaining experience from part-time employment in the retail, hospitality, labor, and software industries.</li>
			<li>My 4th Year Masters dissertation project involved a lot of Python and MATLAB coding where I used rudimentary mathematical techniques to verify the Riemann Hypothesis for the first 100,000 zeros. This project gained me 78% and helped drive me towards my first-class degree.</li>
			<li>My experience in pure maths has taught me to be a creative problem solver and strong analytic thinker, something incredibly powerful in research.</li>
			<li>I am constantly pushing myself to learn and obtain life experiences.  I believe my recent years spent studying and specializing in mathematics whilst also working part-time from the age of fifteen has proven to mold me into the well-rounded person I am today.</li>
			<li>On the one hand, my four years of studying university mathematics demonstrates not only my ability in maths, problem solving, and research (as graduating with a first-class honors degree from a Russel Group University takes more than just a skill in the chosen subject) but also it also shows my commitment, hard-work, dedication, and efficient organization skills. All of which were vital to my degree.</li>
			<li>In contrast to this, my years of experience in multiple retail and catering/hospitality roles over the years has taught me a wide range of other useful skills. Such as working in a team environment (big or small), cooperating with colleagues, and to always have a solid work ethic.</li>

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
